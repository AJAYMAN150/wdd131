      <p>Hello, I am Alfred James Vaka Jr, but I prefer to go by AJ amongst family and friends. Born on the island of Oahu, I am of Tongan descent and raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Fun fact, Tonga is one of six countries in the Pacific to still have a Monarchy</p>
